# AIMSEngine MAP Function Requirements Document

## Overview

The MAP function is a critical component of AIMSEngine, designed to provide a comprehensive view of AI systems across an organization. It aligns with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF) to ensure robust and effective AI governance, risk management, and compliance.

## Scope

The MAP function will focus on documenting and managing AI systems, applications, and use cases within the organization, including those developed in-house or integrated from third-party applications.

## Core Components of the MAP Function

### AI System Overview

- **Category & Type:** Classify the AI system based on its function (e.g., predictive, generative, etc.).
- **Task & Functionality:** Describe the specific tasks the AI system is designed to perform.
- **Methodology Used:** Outline the approaches and techniques employed in developing and deploying the AI system.
- **Description:** Provide a brief summary of the AI system.

### Governance and Compliance

- **Assumptions Made:** Record any assumptions that underpin the AI system’s development or operation.
- **AI Team Participants:** Document the key individuals and teams responsible for the AI system.
- **AI Auditor Details:** Provide information on the individuals or entities responsible for auditing the AI system.
- **AI Insurance Details:** Include any insurance coverage related to the AI system.
- **Regulatory Compliance Mapping:** Map the specific geo- and industry-specific regulations that apply to the AI system.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Include fields for documenting ethical considerations, potential biases, and fairness in AI decision-making processes.
- **Policies & Standards:** Document relevant internal policies and external standards the AI system adheres to.
- **Compliance Status:** Track the current compliance state of the AI system.

### Performance and Risk Management

- **Usage, Goals, Expected Benefits:** Define how the AI system is intended to be used, its goals, and expected benefits.
- **Costs:** Record the financial costs associated with the AI system.
- **Anomaly Impact Assessment:** Track potential anomalies and their impacts on the system's performance.
- **Risk Factors (Anticipated & Non-Anticipated):** Identify and evaluate both expected and unexpected risks.
- **Contextual Factors:** Provide context to frame the identified risks.
- **Incident Reporting and Response:** Track past incidents, response strategies, and lessons learned.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Monitor the AI system's effectiveness.

### Lifecycle and Change Management

- **AI Actors:** Define the AI system’s interaction with other systems and human actors.
- **Process & Lifecycle:** Document the AI system’s lifecycle, from development to deployment and beyond.
- **Participants:** List all stakeholders involved in the AI system’s lifecycle.
- **Versions (Iterations & Application):** Track the various iterations and applications of the AI system over time.
- **Data Provenance and Integrity:** Monitor data sources, handling processes, and integrity checks.
- **Decommissioning Plan:** Outline the process for retiring the AI system.

### Monitoring and Automation

- **Automated Monitoring and Alerts:** Leverage ALIA AI to automate monitoring processes, providing real-time alerts and insights based on the complex temporal data analyzed.
- **Prescriptive Actions:** Utilize AI-driven insights to recommend prescriptive actions in response to detected anomalies.
- **Monitoring Frequency:** Specify how often the AI system is monitored.
